 <br> 
     </p> 
 <p>When initially released in the mid-2000s, it was to be the portable equivalent of what Windows desktop OS was: a major force in the then-emerging mobile/portable areas.</p>

<p>Following the rise of newer smartphone OSs (iOS and Android) Windows Mobile never equalled the success and faded 
rapidly in the following years.</p>

<p>By February 2010,Microsoft announced the more modern and consumer-focused Windows Phone to supersede Windows Mobile.</p>
<p>As a result, Windows Mobile has been deprecated since existing devices and software are incompatible with Windows Phone.</p>
